The solution involves using the `!important` flag to force the desired style to override the less specific style. While generally discouraged for overuse, it is effective in this specific scenario.

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

p {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.container p {
  background-color: lightgreen !important; /* Force the override with !important */
}
```

This ensures that `lightgreen` will always override `lightcoral`, resolving the unexpected inheritance issue.
