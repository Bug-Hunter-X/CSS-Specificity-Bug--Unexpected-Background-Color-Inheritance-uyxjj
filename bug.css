The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance.  The `.container` class has a background color, but the nested `<p>` tag's background color overrides it due to specificity.

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

p {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.container p {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This style should override lightcoral, but doesn't always */
}
```

In some cases, depending on other styles and browser inconsistencies, the `lightgreen` might not override `lightcoral`. This can be subtle and hard to debug.
